STAR: Revolutionizing Technical Standards with AI

We have Implemented the following:
Abstractive summary - SpaCy Library:
We utilize the SpaCy library for NLP tasks. Unlike extractive summaries, abstractive methods generate new, concise content. After cleaning the text, we create a normalized word frequency map to weigh sentences.

Named Entity Recognition (NER):
We use NER to identify predefined topics in text. This approach is effective when a text consistently references certain topics, enhancing our content understanding.

Topic Modelling - Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA):
We employ LDA to classify document text to specific topics. By using bags of words, we determine keyword relevance without the need for predetermined topics.

Here, is our Future Scope:
We plan to deploy a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) on technical mission requirement datasets. Using RNN, we aim for higher accuracy by focusing on technical keywords and normalizing data based on topics.
